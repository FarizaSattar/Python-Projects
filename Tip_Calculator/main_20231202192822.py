# Tip Calculator

''' The code is a tip calculator that takes the total bill, desired tip percentage, and number of people to 
split the bill among, calculating the amount each person should pay and displaying it. '''

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?"))

tip_as_percent = tip / 100
total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)

print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
