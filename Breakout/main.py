# Breakout

''' The code utilizes Python's Turtle module to create a basic structure for a Breakout game clone, 
initializing the game window, paddle, and ball elements with their initial properties, but lacks complete game 
mechanics such as ball movement, collisions, and scoring. '''

import turtle

# Set up the screen
wn = turtle.Screen()  # Create the game window
wn.title("Breakout Clone")  # Set window title
wn.bgcolor("black")  # Set background color
wn.setup(width=600, height=600)  # Set window dimensions
wn.tracer(0)  # Disable automatic screen updates

# Paddle
paddle = turtle.Turtle()  # Create the paddle object
paddle.speed(0)  # Set paddle animation speed
paddle.shape("square")  # Set paddle shape
paddle.color("white")  # Set paddle color
paddle.shapesize(stretch_wid=1, stretch_len=5)  # Set paddle size
paddle.penup()  # Lift the pen to prevent drawing
paddle.goto(0, -250)  # Set initial paddle position

# Ball
ball = turtle.Turtle()  # Create the ball object
ball.speed(0)  # Set ball animation speed
ball.shape("circle")  # Set ball shape
ball.color("white")  # Set ball color
ball.penup()  # Lift the pen to prevent drawing
ball.goto(0, 0)  # Set initial ball position
# [More ball properties and game logic should be added here]

# The code initializes a basic environment for a Breakout game clone using Python's Turtle module,
# setting up the game window, paddle, and ball elements, though the ball properties and game logic are incomplete.
